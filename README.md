# Chess Game
This is the very first project I wrote when I starting to learn C++, which is a simplified version of chess. The chess board is printed on the terminal, and the users take turns to input the start position and end position of the pieces to compete with each other. Feel free to try it by yourselves.
# Some improvements when looking back again 5 years later
1. Use OpenGL to write a interactive GUI.
2. Add an AI with some ML models.
3. I think I have already included all the cases for the moves of the pieces, like if the path is blocked and the promotion of the pawn. But the only end way of the game is the king of one of the players is captured by the other. I think I may include the check for some cases like the king is definetly be captured and end the game too.
